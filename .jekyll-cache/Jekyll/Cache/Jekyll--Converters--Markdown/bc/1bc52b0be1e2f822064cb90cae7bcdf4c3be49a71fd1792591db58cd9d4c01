I"È	<p>As mentioned above, One-time Pad(OTP) is regarded as a cryptosystem of perfect secrecy. But unfortunately, it is not easy to implement in practice because the pad needs to be as long as the plaintext and cannot be reused. If you can transmit the pad safely without being intercepted by the adversary, then why bother using the cipher in the first place?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we can sacrifice some degree of secrecy that the OTP provides in exchange for some efficiency. <em>Block ciphers</em> are invented for that purpose. They divide the plaintext message into blocks of the same length and encrypt them using the same keys.</p>

<p>Created by IBM in 1974, <em>Data Encryption Standard</em>(DES) became the standard for encrypting sensitive US government data and was widely applied internationally later on. As a block cipher, it divides the binary message into blocks with a length of 64-bit and uses 56-bit keys to encrypt them.</p>

<p>The <em>Feistel network</em> is used in the algorithm, which means that the 64-bit input is evenly divided into two 32-bit half blocks and they are processed for 16 identical rounds. In each round, the operations on the blocks include:</p>

<p><em>Expansion</em>: adding more bits into the blocks</p>

<p><em>Key-mixing</em>: combining the blocks with the subkey that is derived from the key</p>

<p><em>Substitution</em>: dividing the 32-bit blocks into 6-bit ones, substituting them with 4-bit blocks according to a fixed table</p>

<p><em>Permutation</em>: rearranging the output of substitution according to a fixed permutation</p>

<p>As the computers become more capable, the DES with keys of only 56 bits gradually became unsafe. It was proved to be vulnerable to the attacks that target its padding process. <em>3DES</em>, a cipher that applies the DES three times to each data block, is developed later to enhance its security level. The <em>AES</em> replaced it as the US government standard in 2001.</p>
