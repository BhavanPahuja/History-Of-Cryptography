I" <p>For most of the public key cipher that we used today, such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman or ECC, the quantum computer’s successful invention will be their doomsday. The difficult mathematical problems they rely on will no longer be infeasible for the computer to solve efficiently.</p>

<p>To prepare for that day to come, the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) of the USA held a competition to find suitable ciphers that can resist the attack from quantum computers and standardize them.</p>

<p>Now the competition is in the third round. Three of the four remaining public key encryption candidates are lattice-based.</p>

<p>Lattice-based ciphers are constructed on high-dimension lattice problems. For example, finding the closest lattice point to a given location is easy in a two or three-dimensional lattice. But if the number of dimensions and basis vectors is as high as tens of thousands, the shortest vector problem becomes infeasible to solve even for a quantum computer.</p>
