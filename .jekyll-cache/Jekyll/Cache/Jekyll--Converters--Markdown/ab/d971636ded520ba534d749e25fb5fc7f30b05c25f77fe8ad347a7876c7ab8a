<p>To begin with, significant cryptanalytic advances originated from one of the initial descriptions of cryptanalysis and frequency from the first page of al-Kindi’s manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages.  This discovery was driven by the analysis of the Quran which induced the invention of the frequency analysis technique. A method was used for solving monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.[3] These in substitution ciphers each character has a corresponding ciphertext that is agreed upon by the sender and the receiver. The messages are then created by substituting the regular characters in the message with the ciphertext characters.[1] The frequency analysis technique Looks at each letter’s occurrences and compares them to the frequency pattern of letters in a language.[2]</p>
