<p>The Spartan military is believed to have used a device called Scytale to send secret messages. The device consisted of a cylinder around which a parchment strip was spirally wrapped which contained the message.   This was a transportation cipher in which the sequence of characters is changed instead of the characters themselves. This meant that when the strip was unwrapped, the letters would be scrambled and could only be deciphered by rewrapping the strip on an identical cylinder. It is although unclear if these devices were used for security or for superstitious purposes.</p>
