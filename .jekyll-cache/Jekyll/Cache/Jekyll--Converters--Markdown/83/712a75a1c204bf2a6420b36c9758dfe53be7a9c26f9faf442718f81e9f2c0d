<p>Developed by Gilbert Vernam and later refined by Joseph Mauborgne into what was coined the “one-time pad” , the <strong>“Stream Cipher”</strong> is a cipher in which the characters of a plaintext are encrypted one-by-one by combining with a psuedorandom stream of characters. The combining operation is typically an exclusive-or (XOR) and the cipher is symmetrical (the same key encrypts and decrypts it in-order).</p>

<p>Despite their age, stream ciphers are still widely used today in various forms, and are considered among the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.</p>
