<p>As a result of this <em>frequency analysis technique</em>, virtually all ciphers were rendered vulnerable. That was until Leone Battista Alberti came into the picture when he  developed the <em>polyalphabetic subsutution cipher</em>. The Vigenere Cipher is a notable example of this.</p>

<p>The polyalphabetic ciphers reduce the <em>frequency pattern</em> of letters in a ciphertext by converting a shared secret shift word by converting each letter in the word to the corresponding letter in the alphabet. Then the Sequence of numbers is repeated across the message. Finally, the message is encrypted by shifting the letter of the message according to the number from earlier.</p>
