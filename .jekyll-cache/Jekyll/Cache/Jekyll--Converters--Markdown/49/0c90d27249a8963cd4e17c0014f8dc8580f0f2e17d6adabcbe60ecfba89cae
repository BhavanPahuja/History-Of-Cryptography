<p>Another wonderful example of the innovation in cryptography driven by political and religious unrest and the need for securely encrypted messages was the <em>Great Cipher</em>.  King Louis XIV of France hired Antoine Rossignol, a brilliant cryptographer, to help ensure that his correspondences remained private.  The <em>Great Cipher</em> wasnâ€™t broken until 1893, and even then some parts of it are still enciphered.  The <em>Great Cipher</em> was a nomenclature cipher that used symbols to represent vowel sounds, a trick that made it extremely difficult to decipher.  There were several different versions of nomenclators for the <em>Great Cipher</em>, but the main one was composed of 711 different symbols representing 587 different sounds.  Notably, the <em>Great Cipher</em> played a part in the mystery of the man in the iron mask.  As well, many French documents from this time period were encoded using this cipher.</p>
