I"¾<p>For most <em>public-key ciphers</em> that we use today, such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman or ECC, the <em>quantum computer</em>â€™s successful implementation will be their doomsday. The difficult mathematical problems they rely on will no longer be infeasible for the computer to solve efficiently.</p>

<p>To cope with the threat that the quantum computer may pose to data security, the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) of the USA holds a competition to find ciphers that can resist the attacks from quantum computers and standardize them.</p>

<p>Now the competition is in its third round, and the NIST is yet to decide on the new standard. Three of the four remaining public key encryption candidates are <em>lattice-based</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lattice-based ciphers</em> are constructed on high-dimensional lattice problems. For example, finding the closest lattice point to a given location is easy in a two or three-dimensional lattice. But if the number of dimensions is as high as tens of thousands, the <em>shortest vector problem(SVP)</em> becomes infeasible to solve even for a quantum computer.</p>
