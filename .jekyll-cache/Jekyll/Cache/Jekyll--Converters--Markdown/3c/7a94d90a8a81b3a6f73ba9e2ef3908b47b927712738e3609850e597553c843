I"A<p>In 1949, Claude E. Shannon’s paper, Communication theory of secrecy systems was published, marking the birth of modern cryptography.</p>

<p>As one of the most famous cryptographers in human history, Shanon was the first man to research cryptography scientifically. In his paper, he gave a mathematical description of a secrecy system and proposed a definition of perfect secrecy. According to Shannon, a cryptosystem is unbreakable when the encrypted message indicates nothing about the plain text if the adversaries only make ciphertext-only attacks. OTP can be regarded as an example of perfect secrecy.</p>

<p>In a word, Shannon transformed cryptography from art to science. He laid a solid foundation for the future development of modern cryptography.</p>
