I"ï<p>Using Hash functions is like recording the fingerprint of files. The first hash function that has been widely used in cryptography is the MD5 designed by Ronald Rivest, who is also one of the three cryptographers that invented RSA.</p>

<p>Unlike encryption using ciphers like AES or RSA, hashing is a <em>one-direction</em> process. It turns the documents, no matter how large they are, into random digest with fixed length. The computer is unable to convert the digest back to plaintext. Hash functions are used in cryptography to <em>ensure data integrity</em> and <em>store passwords safely</em>.</p>

<p>When someone sends a message to others, they may send the hashing output of the message together with the message itself. The receiver can hash the received message to see if the hashing results match and ensure that the message is not tampered with.</p>

<p>Hash functions can also be used to store passwords. Even if adversaries get hold of the file that stored the passwordsâ€™  digest, they cannot retrieve the passwords. When a user tries to log in, the authentication system can hash the password and see if it matches the password digest stored in the system.</p>

<p>Although MD5 is still widely used today, it has been proved to have severe vulnerabilities and can be easily cracked.  There are more secure hashing functions to replace it, like the Secure Hashing Algorithms(SHA) family, especially the most recently published one, SHA-3.</p>
