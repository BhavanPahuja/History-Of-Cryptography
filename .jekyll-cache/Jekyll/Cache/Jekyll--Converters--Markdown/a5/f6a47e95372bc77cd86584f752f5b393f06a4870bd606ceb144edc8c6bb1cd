<p>The Riverbank publications were a series of pamphlets produced by George Fabyan’s Riverbank Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois. They included many novel discoveries in cryptography and cryptanalysis (among other topics). Publication #22 in particular was groundbreaking as it introduced the use of statistics in cryptanalysis using William Firedman’s <strong>“Index of Coincidence”</strong>.</p>

<p>Simply put, it is the probability that two randomly selected letters in a text string are equal. The IoC has many applications such as deducing the length of a key for a ciphertext or determining if two ciphertexts are of the same language.</p>
