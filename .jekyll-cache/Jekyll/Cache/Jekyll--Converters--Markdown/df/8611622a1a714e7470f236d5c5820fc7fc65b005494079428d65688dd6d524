<p>The earliest recorded tactical/military use of ciphers comes from Julius Caesar substituting letters to avoid decryption by enemies and ensure secure communication with his troops. In this method, both the receiving and sending party agree on some number and a direction to shift the alphabet by. For example, in the image above, the alphabet is shifted by 3 to the left side. So, the D becomes an A, E becomes B and so on.</p>
