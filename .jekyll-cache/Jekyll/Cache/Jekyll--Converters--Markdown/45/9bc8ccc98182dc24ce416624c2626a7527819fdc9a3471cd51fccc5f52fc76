I"ˇ<p>For most public-key ciphers that we used today, such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman or ECC, the quantum computer‚Äôs successful implementation will be their doomsday. The difficult mathematical problems they rely on will no longer be infeasible for the computer to solve efficiently.</p>

<p>To cope with the threat that the quantum computer may pose to data security, the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) of the USA holds a competition to find ciphers that can resist the attacks from quantum computers and standardize them.</p>

<p>Now the competition is in its third round, and the NIST is yet to decide on the new standard. Three of the four remaining public key encryption candidates are lattice-based.</p>

<p>Lattice-based ciphers are constructed on high-dimension lattice problems. For example, finding the closest lattice point to a given location is easy in a two or three-dimensional lattice. But if the number of dimensions is as high as tens of thousands, the shortest vector problem(SVP) becomes infeasible to solve even for a quantum computer.</p>
