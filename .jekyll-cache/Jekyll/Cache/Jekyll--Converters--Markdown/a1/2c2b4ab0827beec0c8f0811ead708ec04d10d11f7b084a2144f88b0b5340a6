I"@<p>Leon Battista Alberti was known as the ultimate renaissance man.  An architect, artist, author, poet, and philosopher, Alberti was also a talented mathematician and cryptographer, contributing to both fields extensively.</p>

<p>In 1466, Alberti wrote a collection of essays entitled <em>“De componendis cifris”</em>, which roughly translates to <em>“The compiling of ciphers”</em>.  Within these essays, he described his creation, the Alberti cipher, one of the first known <em>polyalphabetic ciphers</em>.  Unlike <em>simple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers</em> which were extremely vulnerable to <em>frequency analysis</em> (looking at the frequency at which certain letter and words appear and comparing them to expected frequencies for a specific language), <em>polyalphabetic ciphers</em> switch encoding alphabets periodically throughout the coded message, making it much more difficult to find patterns in the code.</p>

<p>The Alberti cipher used a cipher wheel that had two differently sized circle disks with the Latin alphabet around the edges, allowing the inner disk to spin and change the encoding alphabet every few words.  Capital letters were used to indicate a rotation had occurred and the predetermined key letter had a new meaning, while the encoded message itself was written in lowercase letters.</p>

<p>Although flawed, Alberti’s cipher was a huge breakthrough for the field of cryptography and variations of the <em>polyalphabetic cipher</em> continued to be used well into the 19th century, earning Alberti the nickname the “Father of Western Cryptography”.</p>
