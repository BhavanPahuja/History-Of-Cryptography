I"h<p>In 1949, Claude E. Shannon’s paper, <em>Communication theory of secrecy systems</em>, was published, marking the birth of modern cryptography.</p>

<p>As one of the most famous cryptographers in human history, Shanon was the first man to research cryptography scientifically. In his paper, he gave a mathematical description of a secrecy system and proposed a definition of <em>perfect secrecy</em>. According to Shannon, a cryptosystem is unbreakable when the encrypted message indicates nothing about the plaintext and the adversaries make ciphertext-only attacks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">One Time Pad</a>(OTP) can be regarded as an example of perfect secrecy.</p>

<p>Shannon transformed cryptography from art to science. He laid a solid foundation for the future development of modern cryptography.</p>
