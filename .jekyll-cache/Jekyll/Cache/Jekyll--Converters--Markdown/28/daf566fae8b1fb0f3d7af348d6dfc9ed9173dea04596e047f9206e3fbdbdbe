<p>To begin with, significant cryptanalytic advances originated from one of the initial descriptions of cryptanalysis and frequency from the first page of al-Kindiâ€™s manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages.  This discovery was driven by the analysis of the Quran which induced the invention of the frequency analysis technique. A method was used for solving monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. These in substitution ciphers each character has a corresponding ciphertext that is agreed upon by the sender and the receiver. The messages are then created by substituting the regular characters in the message with the ciphertext characters. The frequency analysis technique Looks at each letterâ€™s occurrences and compares them to the frequency pattern of letters in a language.[2]</p>
