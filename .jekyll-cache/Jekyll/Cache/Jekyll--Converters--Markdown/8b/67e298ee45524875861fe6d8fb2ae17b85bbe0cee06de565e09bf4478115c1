<p>The first page of al-Kindiâ€™s manuscript and itâ€™s descriptions of <em>cryptanalysis and frequency</em> lead to one of the most significant cryptanalytic advances. This discovery was driven by the analysis of the Quran which induced the invention of the <em>frequency analysis technique</em>. A method was used for solving monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.</p>

<p>In a standard substitution cipher, each character has a corresponding ciphertext that is agreed upon by the sender and the receiver. The messages are then created by substituting the regular characters in the message with the ciphertext characters. The frequency analysis technique looks at each letterâ€™s occurrences and compares them to the frequency pattern of letters in a given language. Through this method, the message can then be decoded by replacing the ciphertext based on its frequency.</p>
