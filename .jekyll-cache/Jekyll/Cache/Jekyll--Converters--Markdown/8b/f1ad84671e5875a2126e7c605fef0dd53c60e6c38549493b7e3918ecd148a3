I"·<p>Cousin to the stream cipher and invented by the same minds, the one-time pad is an uncrackable encryption technique (if applied correctly). The ‚Äúpad‚Äù part of the name comes from the sheets of paper on which the key stream was printed.</p>

<p>The key (no pun intended) difference between the OTP and a standard stream cipher is that the digits in the key stream are truly random. A proper OTP should also have the following properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The key length must be at least equal to the plaintext length</li>
  <li>Only two copies of the pad must ever exist</li>
  <li>Any OTP should only be used once</li>
  <li>Both copies of the OTP must be destroyed immediately post-communication</li>
</ol>

<p>The OTP was very popular among intelligence agents (and is still used today). Spies would often conceal the pads in incospicuous objects such as walnuts, stones and more.
