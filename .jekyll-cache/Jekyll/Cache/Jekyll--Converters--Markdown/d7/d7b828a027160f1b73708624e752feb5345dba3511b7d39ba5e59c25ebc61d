<p>Rotor machines are stream cipher devices that were used to encrypt and decrypt messages (primarily by militaries) in the 20th century. The invention credit for the device is murky as it was simultaneously and somewhat independently worked on by 4 different scientists at the time, and it was later revealed that it may have been invented by 2 dutch naval officers much earlier in the 19th century.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind using rotors is as follows: imagine if you had a typewriter that applied a simple substitution to its letters (an A becomes a P for example). By adding a rotor underneath the key, you can change the mapping by rotating the rotor after each keystroke (so now A maps to Q instead of P). You can then bolster your encryption machine by chaining many rotors together, manipulating the size and type of rotors , and more.</p>

<p>The most famous of the rotor machines were the German Enigma machines invented by Arthur Scheribus (one of the aforementioned 4 scientists). They were first adopted by the Reichsmarine in 1926 and were subsequently adopted by the rest of the German Armed Forces. The Enigma was an elegant invention in that it was simple to build but extremely difficult to break (more on that later).
