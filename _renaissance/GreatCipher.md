Another wonderful example of the innovation in cryptography driven by political and religious unrest and the need for securely encrypted messages was the _Great Cipher_.  King Louis XIV of France hired Antoine Rossignol, a brilliant cryptographer, to help ensure that his correspondences remained private.  The _Great Cipher_ wasnâ€™t broken until 1893, and even then some parts of it are still enciphered.  The _Great Cipher_ was a nomenclature cipher that used symbols to represent vowel sounds, a trick that made it extremely difficult to decipher.  There were several different versions of nomenclators for the _Great Cipher_, but the main one was composed of 711 different symbols representing 587 different sounds.  Notably, the _Great Cipher_ played a part in the mystery of the man in the iron mask.  As well, many French documents from this time period were encoded using this cipher.
