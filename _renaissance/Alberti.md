Leon Battista Alberti was known as the ultimate renaissance man.  An architect, artist, author, poet, and philosopher, Alberti was also a talented mathematician and cryptographer, contributing to both fields extensively.

In 1466, Alberti wrote a collection of essays entitled _“De componendis cifris”_, which roughly translates to _“The compiling of ciphers”_.  Within these essays, he described his creation: the Alberti cipher, one of the first known _polyalphabetic ciphers_.  Unlike _simple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers,_ which are extremely vulnerable to _frequency analysis_ (looking at the frequency at which certain letters and words appear and comparing them to expected frequencies for a specific language), _polyalphabetic ciphers_ switch the encoding alphabet periodically throughout the coded message, making it much more difficult to find patterns in the code.

The Alberti cipher used a cipher wheel that had two differently sized circle disks attached together in the middle by a pin. On the outer ring were the letters of the Latin alphabet in uppercase and some numbers. The inner ring was movable and was inscribed with lowercase letters. One could spin the inner ring and change the encoding alphabet every few words. Capital letters were used to indicate that a rotation had occurred and that the predetermined key letter had a new meaning, while the encoded message itself was written in lowercase letters.

Although flawed, Alberti’s cipher was a huge breakthrough for the field of cryptography. Variations of the _polyalphabetic cipher_ continued to be used well into the 19th century, earning Alberti the nickname the “Father of Western Cryptography”.
