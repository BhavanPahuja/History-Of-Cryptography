As a result of the *frequency analysis technique*, virtually all ciphers were rendered vulnerable until the creation of the *polyalphabetic substitution cipher* by Leone Battista Alberti. The Vigenere Cipher is a notable example of this. This cipher was developed by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, not Vigenere as originally thought, after whom it has been named. 

The polyalphabetic ciphers reduce the *frequency pattern* of letters in a ciphertext by converting a shared secret shift word by converting each letter in the word to the corresponding letter in the alphabet. Then the sequence of numbers is repeated across the message. Finally, the message is encrypted by shifting the letter of the message according to the number from earlier.
