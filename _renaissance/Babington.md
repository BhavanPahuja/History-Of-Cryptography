By the end of the renaissance political and religious frictions were at a new high.  The many plots around this time led to a sudden need for strong ciphers and deciphering techniques, pushing the field of cryptography forward rapidly.  One prominent example of this was the Babington plot.

Elizabeth I was in control of the English thrown, but as a protestant and illegitimate child there were many who wanted to see her overthrown.  Her cousin Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, was a popular potential replacement, especially due to her being Catholic.  Sir Francis Walsingham, spymaster for Elizabeth I, was concerned about these threats.  He hired cryptographer Thomas Phellipes and arranged to have all correspondence to and from Mary go through his double agents.

Although Maryâ€™s messages were all written using a _nomenclature cipher_ that replaced letters and common words with symbols, a copy of the key had been provided by one of the double agents, allowing Phellipes to decrypt every message.  The decoded messages between Mary and a man named Anthony Babington contained plans to kill Elizabeth I and replace her with Mary.  After several months Walsingham had the evidence he needed to convict Mary, Babington, and 13 other co-conspirators of high treason and had them all executed.  The whole situation is one of the first examples of a _Man-in-the-Middle attack_.
