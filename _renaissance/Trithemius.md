title: Johannes Trithemius and Steganographia + Polygraphia
start: 1499
order: 1

Johannes Trithemius was a german abbot during the renaissance period whose life was marked by a thirst for knowledge, especially for cryptography and stenography.  Due to his interest in the occult and reputation as a magician, he’s work was not properly appreciated until after his death.

In 1499, he wrote _Steganographia_, a collection of three books that seemed to relate magical information.  However, true to the field of steganography, which focuses on the ability to hide a message within an object or larger message, the books were eventually revealed to actually be instructions for encrypting and hiding messages in plain sight.  Although the first two books had their decryption keys published in 1606, the true meaning of the third book was not discovered until the late 1990s.

Nineteen years later, Trithemius followed up his work on secret communication with a collection of five books known as _Polygraphia_.  This work was less theoretical than _Steganographia_, instead containing practical knowledge on how to encode information as well as detailed descriptions of around 2000 different alphabets.  The work also contained a table that lays out every possible shift of the alphabet, created by Trithemius as the _tabula recta_.  The _tabula recta_ was used in the _Trithemius cipher_, Johannes’s version of a _polyalphabetic cipher_, as well as being used well into the future by improved _polyalphabetic ciphers_, highlighting it as an important contribution to renaissance cryptography.
