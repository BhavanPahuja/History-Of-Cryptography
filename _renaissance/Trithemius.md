title: Johannes Trithemius and Steganographia + Polygraphia
start: 1499
order: 1
---

Johannes Trithemius was a German abbot during the renaissance period whose life was marked by a thirst for knowledge, especially in the fields of cryptography and stenography. He was also interested in the occult and had a reputation as a magician, and because of that, his work was not properly appreciated until after his death.

In 1499, he wrote _Steganographia_, a collection of three books that seemed to relate information on magic.  However, true to the field of steganography, which is the practice of hiding a message within an object or a larger message, the books were eventually revealed to actually be instructions for encrypting and hiding messages in plain sight.  Although the first two books had their decryption keys published in 1606, the true meaning of the third book was not discovered until the late 1990s.

Nineteen years later, Trithemius followed up his work on secret communication with a collection of five books known as _Polygraphia_.  This work was less theoretical than _Steganographia_, instead containing practical knowledge on how to encode information, as well as detailed descriptions of around 2000 different alphabets.  The work also included a table, created by Trithemius, that laid out every possible shift of the alphabet.  That table was called the _tabula recta_, and would turn out to play a significant role in renaissance cryptography.   The _tabula recta_ was used in the _Trithemius cipher_, Johannesâ€™s version of a _polyalphabetic cipher_, and continued to be used well into the future by improved _polyalphabetic ciphers_.
