Kasiski's test is a method of statistical analysis that utilized the crack polyalphabetic substitution ciphers. Although published by Friedrich Kasiski in 1863, the technique had already been found by Charles Babbage as early as 1846. Sadly the system was attributed to Friedrich as a result of Charles Babbage habit of not finishing the paperwork aspect of his work.
