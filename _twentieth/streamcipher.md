Developed by Gilbert Vernam and later with Joseph Mauborgne into what was coined the "one-time pad" , the **"Stream Cipher"** is a cipher in which the characters of a plaintext are encrypted one-by-one by combining them with a psuedorandom stream of characters. The combining operation is typically an exclusive-or (XOR) and the cipher is symmetrical (the same key encrypts and decrypts it in-order).

Despite their age, stream ciphers are still widely used today in various forms, and are considered among the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.
