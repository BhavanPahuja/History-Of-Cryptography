The breaking of the Enigma is known to most people as the work of Alan Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park in Britian, but actually, the first cracking of Enigma codes was actually spearheaded by three Polish mathematicians; Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski, Jerzy Różycki, and a team of Polish cryptologists.

The Polish codebreakers began intercepting and analyzing Enigma-encrypted German navy communications as early as 1926. By the early 1930s the Polish team had developed a large arsenal of tools and techniques for breaking Enigma encryptions. Among them were mechanical rotor devices that mimicked the Enigma machines - referred to as _bomba_ (singular) - later to be adopted and further developed by Alan Turing.

In 1939, on the cusp of WWII breaking out, the Polish team met with the British and French cryptology teams working on the Enigma as well to share their knowledge (sharing critical intelligence like this with other countries was no small thing at the time).

These heroes of the war never recieved the recognition they deserved, were exiled after the invasion of Poland, and several died or were imprisoned during the course of the war.
