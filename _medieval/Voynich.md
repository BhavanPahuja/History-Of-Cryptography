title: Voynich Manuscript – Undeciphered to this Day
start: 1404 
order: 1
---

Over history, several encrypted documents have been collected that remain unsolved to this day.  Of these, the Voynich manuscript remains one of the oldest, and most well-known examples.  Although many theories have been put forward regarding its history and contents, none of them have been definitively proved to this day.

The manuscript first reached significant public attention in the early 1900’s when it was acquired by Wilfrid Voynich (after whom the manuscript was named), who spent many years attempting to determine its origin and decipher it.  He sent it to many different scholars over the rest of his life, but although many different theories were proposed, none were able to withstand more advanced investigations.  One particularly popular theory is that the manuscript is simply a hoax, either fabricated by Voynich himself, or before he came into its possession.  However, this theory is weakened by the fact that earlier mentions of the manuscript do exist, going back as far as 1639.  As well, the vellum used as parchment for the manuscript has been carbon dated to between 1404 and 1438, numbers consistent between several sections of the book tested.  The ink and paints used are consistent with inks and paints used in Italy in the 15th century, and the words themselves do follow pattern and repetitions that would be expected in actual languages.

Hopefully as cryptanalysis methods researchers will be able to determine more about the origin of the manuscript, one day possibly even deciphering it.
