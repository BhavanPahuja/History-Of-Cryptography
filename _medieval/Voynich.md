title: Voynich Manuscript – Undeciphered to this Day
start: 1404 
order: 1
---

Over history, several encrypted documents have been collected that remain un-deciphered to this day.  Of these, the Voynich manuscript remains one of the oldest, and most well-known examples.  Although many theories have been put forward regarding its history and contents, none of them have been definitively proved yet.

The manuscript first attracted significant public attention in the early 1900’s when it was acquired by Wilfrid Voynich (after whom the manuscript was named). Voynich spent the rest of his life attempting to determine the origin of the manuscript and decipher it, even enlisting the help of many different scholars for this task. Although many different theories were proposed, none were able to withstand more advanced investigations.  One particularly popular theory is that the manuscript is simply a hoax, either fabricated by Voynich himself, or by some unknown person before it came into his possession.  However, this theory is weakened by the fact that earlier mentions of the manuscript do exist, going back as far as 1639.  As well, the vellum used as parchment for the manuscript has been carbon dated to between 1404 and 1438 (several sections of the book were tested, and the dates are all the same).  Moreover, the ink and paints used are consistent with inks and paints used in Italy in the 15th century, and the words themselves do follow pattern and repetitions that would be expected in actual languages.

Hopefully as cryptanalysis methods improve, researchers will be able to determine more about the origin of the manuscript, and possibly even be able to decipher it one day.
