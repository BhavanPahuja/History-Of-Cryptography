The earliest recorded tactical/military use of ciphers comes from Julius Caesar substituting letters to avoid decryption by enemies and ensure secure communication with his troops. With this method, both the receiving and sending parties agree on a number and a direction in which to shift the alphabet. For example, in the image above, the alphabet is shifted by 3 to the left side. So, the D becomes an A, the E becomes B and so on.
