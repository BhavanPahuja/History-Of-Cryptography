The Spartan military is believed to have used a device called Scytale to send secret messages. The device consisted of a cylinder around which a parchment strip, inscribed with a message, was spirally wrapped. This was a type of _transposition cipher_, meaning that the sequence of characters was changed instead of the characters themselves. This meant that when the strip was unwrapped, the letters on the parchment strip would be scrambled and could only be deciphered by rewrapping the strip on an identical cylinder. It is unclear if these devices were used for security or for superstitious purposes.
