When a scribe was hired to tell the life of nobleman Khnumhotep II on the latterâ€™s tomb, he used unusual symbols instead of some of the regular hieroglyphs to hide the meaning of the inscriptions. This was one of the first and most basic ciphers, in which one symbol or character is substituted by another. Over time, these made-up hieroglyphs became easier to decipher.  They are believed to have been used for mystery and amusement. Similar methods were used by the Mesopotamians (1500 B.C.) and Hebrew (600-500 B.C.) scholars.
