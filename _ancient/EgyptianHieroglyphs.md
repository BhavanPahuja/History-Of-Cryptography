When a scribe was hired to the life of nobleman Khnumhotep II on the latterâ€™s tomb, he used hieroglyphics (combination of logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic elements) with a total of over 1,000 distinct characters to hide the meaning of the inscriptions. This was one of the first and most basic ciphers in which one symbol or character is substituted by another. Over time, these hieroglyphs became easier to break but are believed to be used for mystery and amusement. Similar methods were used by the Mesopotamians (1500 B.C.) and Hebrew (600-500 B.C.) scholars.
