In 1949, Claude E. Shannon's paper, _Communication theory of secrecy systems_, was published, marking the birth of modern cryptography.

As one of the most famous cryptographers in human history, Shannon was the first man to research cryptography scientifically. In his paper, he gave a mathematical description of a secrecy system and proposed a definition of _perfect secrecy_. According to Shannon, a cryptosystem is unbreakable as long as the encrypted message indicates nothing about the plaintext and the adversaries make ciphertext-only attacks. [One Time Pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) (OTP) can be regarded as an example of perfect secrecy.

Shannon transformed cryptography from art to science. He laid a solid foundation for the future development of modern cryptography.
