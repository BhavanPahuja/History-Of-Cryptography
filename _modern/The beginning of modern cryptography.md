In 1949, Claude E. Shannon's paper, Communication theory of secrecy systems was published, marking the birth of modern cryptography.

As one of the most famous cryptographers in human history, Shanon was the first man to research cryptography scientifically. In his paper, he gave a mathematical description of a secrecy system and proposed a definition of perfect secrecy. According to Shannon, a cryptosystem is unbreakable when the encrypted message indicates nothing about the plain text if the adversaries only make ciphertext-only attacks. OTP can be regarded as an example of perfect secrecy.

In a word, Shannon transformed cryptography from art to science. He laid a solid foundation for the future development of modern cryptography.
